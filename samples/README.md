# Code Dx Sqlmap Fork Samples

This folder contains information on running the various samples used when validating the changes in this fork. Information for each sample app has been moved into a sub-folder with scripts and test instructions.

Test commands for these apps should be ran from the `sqlmap` root folder. Any standalone scripts provided should be ran from their own folder. (eg for running the WebGoat `sqlmap-webgoat.sh` script, you should run it within the `sqlmap/samples/webgoat` folder.)

For simplicity and consistency, the main requirements for running these apps are only Docker and Bash.
